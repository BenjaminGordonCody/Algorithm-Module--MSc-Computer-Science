# Algorithm Module, MSc Computer Science
 Python exercises/coursework for a university module about algorithms and complexity. 

Whilst I'm happy with the actual Python code in these examples, they are *extremely* over commented. This was a requirement of the marking scheme for the module. Commenting less than this would have cost me marks, and I really want that Distinction.
